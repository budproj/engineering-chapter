## Why

While coding and exploring complex structures, it is common to stumble upon generic and global issues. Some tech debts, or even RFCs, are too broad to fit into a given repository. Those should be placed inside this repository. We should not have any code here, only issues, dicussions, and global documentation.

## Contributing
